von Neumann dataset    

You can use this dataset to create an emulation of von Neumann.   

so far we have:
- biography from book and wiki
- quotes
- talk: can we survive technology

caveats:  
- there are sometimes irregular line spacings (e.g. two line spaces as a book goes to the next page)
- spaces in the middle of a word
- there are symbols within the lecture notes


to be added:
- interview transcript
- von neumann papers and works
- lecture notes
- video transcriptions
- unpublished manuscripts
- Biographies about him
- Accounts from his colleagues and students
